                    <div id='amazon-info' class='content work-content'> I received a glowing recommendation after my internship at Amazon, Brisbane. Here I engaged in full-stack, end-to-end development, with a JS, TS, Kotlin, Java, and XML stack hosted on AWS with NoSQL databases. Here, I independently managed my projects while collaborating with international stakeholders as well as working closely with a team to further team goals and projects. I also took this opportunity to run team SCRUM meetings and coordinated stand-ups and retro’s.
