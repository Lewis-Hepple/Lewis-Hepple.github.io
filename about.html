            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to read through my website. 
                My name is Lewis, I am a 25 year old Computer Science Student currently working as a part time Software Development Consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional experience includes my current role as an undergraduate software consultant engineer at
                Integral where I am exposed to a variety of different internal and external problem-solving tasks. 
                An internship at Amazon, Brisbane, where I engaged in full-stack, end-to-end development and an internship at TallyStone where I worked in back-end development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love extreme sports like snowboarding, surfing and climbing and I love to travel, visiting over 20 countries and spending 5 years backpacking the world.
                I also love to play video games and am currently playing Balders Gate 3
            </p>
            <p>
                In tech I am particularly passionate about data analytics, software architecture, and systems programming.
                My proficiency in OO, Linux, Git, Programming and DevOps systems, along with my eagerness to continuously expand my skill set,
                make me a well-rounded candidate.
            </p>
